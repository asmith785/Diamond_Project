For my final project my goal was to evaluate the diamonds dataset provided by kaggle to see what variables have a high correlation to price and use those variables in order to make a prediction model.


 The first step was conducting an exploratory data analysis to see if there were null values , missed labeled columns along with any information that may seem of value. It is very  important to determine which features to explore and which to eliminate. This will help us narrow down our focus. To my luck this dataset did not contain any null values but I did have to rename a few columns for readability.  I also explored the cut, color, and clarity column to determine how dense was each value related to the data for example how many columns contain ideal cut diamonds compared to the other cuts.  Unfortunately we do not know where exactly this dataset came from for example ‘diamonds in zalez, tiffany’s or USA’  this way we can have a better idea in regards to density.
The clarity, color and  cut column does not show up in the correlation because the variables in that column are nominal.  Nominal data is data that can be labeled or classified into mutually exclusive categories within a variable. In order to include in our test and train split along with see the correlation this data has to be numerical. Due to the nature of these columns being from least to best. I changed the values to be ordinal (example 1-10). I was very surprised that the cut, color and clarity had a negative correlation with price. Which proved my  initial hypothesis to be incorrect because of this I changed my test and train to take in the variables length, width, inner_depth, table instead. While conducting a linear regression model on these variables I received a predicted score of 78% accuracy.
I believe if I may out one hot encoded the clarity, color and cut instead there may or been a better correlation compared to changing the variables to ordinal.
